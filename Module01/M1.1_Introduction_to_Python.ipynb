    "Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991. \n",
    "\n",
    "Today, Python is widely used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more. To get started, you’ll need to install Python and choose an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm, or VS Code.\n",

    "- Basic syntax rules (indentation, comments)\n",
    "- Data types: integers, floats, strings, booleans\n",
    "\n",
    "Python’s syntax is designed to be readable and straightforward. Unlike many languages, Python uses indentation to define blocks of code. Comments can be added using the `#` symbol. Python supports several basic data types, including integers, floats for decimal numbers, strings for text, and booleans for true/false values.\n",

    "“Control flow statements allow you to execute code based on conditions and repeatedly execute code blocks. The `if` statement checks a condition and executes code accordingly. You can add `elif` for additional conditions and `else` for the default case. Looping is done using `for` loops, which iterate over sequences, and `while` loops, which run as long as a condition is true. The `break` statement exits a loop, and `continue` skips to the next iteration.”\n",

Methods like `lower()` and `upper()` change the case of the string, `replace()` substitutes parts of the string, and `find()` locates substrings. You can also slice strings to extract parts of them.”\n"
